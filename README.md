## Concept

The *Game of Life* is a cellular automaton defined by four simple rules, applied simultaneously on a two-dimensional grid:

- a live cell survives with 2 or 3 live neighbors,
- a live cell dies from underpopulation or overpopulation,
- a dead cell becomes alive with exactly 3 live neighbors.

From these local rules emerge stable, oscillating, and moving structures.
